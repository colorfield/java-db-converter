Java based Database converter

Theoritical work that represents a source relational database into an object oriented model to create a bridge to the destination database.
This is not a production version (many excellent specialized tools are covering this use case) but a pedagogical approach.
Scope covered : tables and view, primary and foreign keys, data types (varchar, int, date, ...).

The object representation is viewable in this UML diagram
